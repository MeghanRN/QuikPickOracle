3_03,2,"I've rebooted the cooler; what's next?","Lock abnormal means the Jupiter senses the lock but its default state isn’t as expected—often due to software control or physical blockage. Next, confirm the software version: open the Service UI and navigate to the BasicInfo section. Verify the SW version; if it’s incorrect, take a photo of the BasicInfo screen and contact the CV company to get the proper update. After updating, return to BasicInfo and ensure the new version is displayed before proceeding."
3_03,3,"I've confirmed the software version is correct; what's next?","Now test the lock and lock‑signal functionality to rule out mechanical blockage: physically open the door by pulling the handle.

If the cable insulation or connector shows damage, replace the entire assembly before moving on."
3_03,5,"I've ensured the lock cable is properly connected; what's next?","Next, confirm the RFID pairing: open the FQC App and view the pairing between the reader and tag. If the reader and tag IDs match, the pairing is correct. If they differ, re‑pair them per the CV company’s procedure or contact CV support for assistance. Once re‑paired, repeat the lock‑signal functionality test in the Service UI (Step 3)."
3_03,6,"I've re‑paired the RFID and repeated the previous tests; what's next?","Cycle through Steps 1–5 until each one passes. If all items PASS but the OPEN_LOCK_FAIL_TIMEOUT error still appears, the lock hardware itself may be faulty. At that point, replace the lock mechanism or escalate to your CV company’s advanced support for deeper diagnostics."
