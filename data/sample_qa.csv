3_03,How to troublshoot?,Start by rebooting the cooler.
3_03,I've re‑paired the RFID and repeated the previous tests; what's next?,"Cycle through Steps 1–5 until each one passes. If all items PASS but the OPEN_LOCK_FAIL_TIMEOUT error still appears, the lock hardware itself may be faulty. At that point, replace the lock mechanism or escalate to your CV company’s advanced support for deeper diagnostics."
3_03,I've ensured the lock cable is properly connected; what's next?,"Next, confirm the RFID pairing: open the FQC App and view the pairing between the reader and tag. If the reader and tag IDs match, the pairing is correct. If they differ, re‑pair them per the CV company’s procedure or contact CV support for assistance. Once re‑paired, repeat the lock‑signal functionality test in the Service UI."
3_03,I've verified the lock disengages via the Service UI; what's next?,"Inspect the lock cable assembly: power off the cooler and remove the control‑box cover. Using the electrical diagram on the cover and the PC sticker as guides, locate the cable labeled “LOCK.” Confirm the connector is fully seated on the Jupiter and tighten as needed. If the cable insulation or connector shows damage, replace the entire assembly before moving on."
3_03,I've confirmed the software version is correct; what's next?,"Now test the lock and lock‑signal functionality to rule out mechanical blockage: physically open the door by pulling the handle. If the lock remains engaged, access the Service UI, tap “Operation,” then “Open Door.” If the lock disengages on command, the lock mechanism and control signal are functioning properly."
3_03,I've rebooted the cooler; what's next?,"Lock abnormal means the Jupiter senses the lock but its default state isn’t as expected—often due to software control or physical blockage. Next, confirm the software version: open the Service UI and navigate to the BasicInfo section. Verify the SW version; if it’s incorrect, take a photo of the BasicInfo screen and contact the CV company to get the proper update. After updating, return to BasicInfo and ensure the new version is displayed before proceeding."
3_03,How to troubleshoot?,"Start by rebooting the cooler. Press the GFCI’s RESET button, unplug and re-plug the mains cord, then open the Service UI → “Reboot” dialog."
